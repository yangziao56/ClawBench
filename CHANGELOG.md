and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add two isolated environmental-observation request pilots for NOAA water levels and USGS daily discharge, with explicit outcome and validation limits.
- `run-meta.json` now carries a `provenance` block: the ClawBench version, commit, branch, and dirty state; the corpus suite and the revision of the commit that last touched it; and the agent and plugin versions pinned by the harness Dockerfile, with a `pins_source` saying whether those pins describe the image that actually ran. Every field is best-effort and null outside a git checkout, so a run never fails on a missing one. See [`docs/trace-cookbook.md`](docs/trace-cookbook.md#provenance).
- Added `scripts/export_openeval.py`, an additive script exporting a batch's `rescore-summary.json` as an [EvalPort](https://github.com/adhabnr-ux/evalport) `ResultSet` Thanks to [@adhabnr-ux](https://github.com/adhabnr-ux).
- Added a `--browser-runtime kernel` mode to the Harbor adapter that runs each task against one Kernel cloud browser, exposing only a credential-free CDP bridge to the agent, and finalizes the replay and deletes the browser during verification.

### Changed
- Container-engine detection is now lazy: `run_support.config.engine()` probes PATH on first use instead of at import time, so importing the runner modules no longer requires Docker or Podman. `config.ENGINE` still resolves but is deprecated.
- `runner/batch.py` now uses the shared `config.engine()` instead of its own copy of the PATH probe.
- The `claw-eval` port now uses the same `test-cases/<suite>/<task-identifier>/task.json` layout as the native corpora, instead of flat `<task-identifier>.json` files. Case discovery in `clawbench-batch` and the TUI is a plain `*/task.json` search again, and the `validate-task` workflow covers the suite without special-casing.
- Changed the default Harbor version to `0.22.0`.

### Fixed
- Isolate `clawbench-reproduce` downloads in a per-invocation cache directory so cleanup preserves existing work-directory files and removes only owned downloads, including on failure.
- Align public discovery metadata with the canonical repository and shipping corpus, label historical V1 scores in both READMEs, and correct the v0.10.0 citation release date.
- Host-timeout container termination now uses the lazy container-engine resolver.
- Added host-side container and batch-job timeouts so a wedged run cannot stall a batch indefinitely.
- Fixed a judge-provider outage (or an unparseable judge reply) being recorded as an agent failure. `run.py` now exits 3 instead of 1 when the judge never renders a verdict, `batch.py` gives it its own `judge_inconclusive` bucket in `batch-summary.json` instead of folding it into `failed`, and `clawbench-rescore` now retries a cached `match: null` verdict even without `--force`.
- Fail task setup when PurelyMail returns an API error instead of emitting credentials for an account that was not created.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-30
### Added
- Added Kernel as a managed remote browser runtime with live view and downloaded replay recordings. Thanks to @[rgarcia](https://github.com/rgarcia).
- Added `clawbench-analyze` entrypoint for aggregate batch error analysis.

### Changed
- Updated the harbor adaptor to support the full V2 lenient & strict and reports numeric results.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where malformed per-run metadata could prevent `batch-summary.json` from being written and, when configured, uploaded.
- Fixed the issue that an invalid judge model would lose the `run-meta.json` file.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-18
### Added
- Added support for the [WebBrain](https://github.com/webbrain-one/webbrain) harness. Thanks to @alectimison-maker.

### Fixed
- Fixed the handling of judge LLM API returns malformed JSON, which caused undetermined behavior when the of the LLM judge.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-04
### Fixed
- Fixed the issue that the x11vnc is not started properly in `--human` mode.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Supported Browserbase as a remote browser runtime for less resource consumption and better scalability.

### Fixed

- Fixed Hermes startup with custom OpenAI-compatible model endpoints.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-01
### Added
- Added support for remote browsers with CDP connection.
- Added a preflight API call to check if the LLM API is valid before starting actual tasks.
- Added support for using Gemini API as a judge.
- Added a random-click baseline harness to provide a baseline for comparison with LLM agents.
- Added the adaptor to make ClawBench V2 compatible with the EdgeBench/SForge benchmark.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-22
### Added
- Added support for the [Harbor framework](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) through an adaptor to generate harbor-compatible task definitions.

### Changed
- Refactored the container runtime to move the action recording and screenshot capturing logic into the CDP server rather than the Chrome extension, making it possible to integrate remote browsers in the future.

### Removed
- Removed harbor as a runtime harness. Rather, it will be used as a benchmark runner to better utilize its capabilities.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-04
### Added
- Added support for the [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) framework.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-24
### Added
- Added display of live token cost estimation during the run.

### Fixed
- Fixed the issue that Claude Code Chrome Extension harness cannot be build due to upstream changes and pinned to a fixed version.
- Fixed the issue that in TUI the color highlight is not moving properly with the selection arrow.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-23
### Fixed
- Fixed several mismatches in task definitions and the provided extra information.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-22
### Added
- Added scripts for rescoring and reproducing the benchmark results based on disclosed trajectories.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-19
### Changed
- More data are stored in the `run-meta.json` for better post-hoc analysis and reproducibility, including the hash of the configs, runtime info, and flags used.

### Fixed
- Fixed several compatibility issues on Windows platforms.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-15
### Added
- Added the logic to remove the `.log` files from the generated `data/` directory to remove noise.
- Added the handling to allow models with no visual capabilities to use the `claude-code-browser-extension` harness by skipping the screenshot steps.
- Added retry logic to the `claude-code-browser-extension` harness to handle temporary rate limits.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- Removed v1-799 and v2-795 tasks since the current interception schemas have risk of leaking the agent's final action to the end server, which leads to unexpected disturbance of the end business.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-09
### Added
- Added support for the **pi** harness — [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) + [`pi-browser-harness`](https://github.com/amankumarsingh77/pi-browser-harness)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-08
### Changed
- Migrated the PyPI package to `clawbench-eval` instead of `clawbenchmark`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- Included the `static/` directory in the package distribution, ensuring markdowns render properly on PyPI.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- Added support for additional harnesses: `opencode`, `claude-code`,
  `claude-code-chrome-extension`, `codex`, `browser-use`, `claw-code`, and
  `hermes`, alongside the existing `openclaw` harness.
- Added the V2 suite under `test-cases/v2/`, with 130 new tasks.
- Added the V1-Lite suite under `test-cases/v1-lite/`, with 20 curated V1 tasks for faster testing.
- Added CI workflows for automated testings and release management.
- Published the package to PyPI as [`clawbenchmark`](https://pypi.org/project/clawbenchmark/).

### Changed
- Refactored the codebase into a package-oriented structure under
  `src/clawbench/` for better modularity and maintainability.
- Updated packaging so runtime harnesses, the Chrome extension, model templates,
  and V1/V2/V1-Lite task suites are bundled for installs without cloning the
  repository.
- Updated the FAQ and usage examples for the expanded harness and suite support.
- Switched to use `hatchling` as the build backend for better packaging and distribution management.

### Fixed
- Fixed packaging and building processes that previously generated malformed distributions.
